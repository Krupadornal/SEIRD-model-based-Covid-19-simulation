SEIRD-model-based-Covid-19-simulation

There are two Ipython Notebook files available:
"CPT_591_ABM_SEIRD_with_RIDGE_PREDICTION_VER2.ipynb" and"CPT_S-591_Graph.ipynb"

In "CPT_591_ABM_SEIRD_with_RIDGE_PREDICTION_VER2.ipynb", the code utilizes the "st_99" library to draw a map of the United States and mark the abbreviated state names. it imports COVID-19 epidemic data for all US states, including files named "confirmed_cases.csv", "recovered_case.csv", and "death_cases_csv", Additionally, population data is imported from"pop_age_prop_ver2.csv".The notebook implements an epidemic simulator.

In "CPT_S_591_Graph.ipynb", the code preprocesses air flight information from a file named ""
